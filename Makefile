# Edit with caution! Travis CI uses this target. ¶ We run docs-clean before
# docs-html to ensure a complete build. (Warnings are emitted only when a file
# is compiled, and Sphinx does not needlessly recompile.) More broadly, we
# order dependencies by execution time and (anecdotal) likelihood of finding
# issues. ¶ `test-coverage` is a functional superset of `test`. Why keep both?
