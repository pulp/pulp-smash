class Client():
    """A convenience object for working with an API.

    This class is a wrapper around the ``requests.api`` module provided by
    `Requests`_. Each of the functions from that module are exposed as methods
    here, and each of the arguments accepted by Requests' functions are also
    accepted by these methods. The difference between this class and the
    `Requests`_ functions lies in its configurable request and response
    handling mechanisms.

    This class is flexible enough that it should be usable with any API, but
    certain defaults have been set to work well with `Pulp`_.

    As an example of basic usage, let's say that you'd like to create a user,
    then read that user's information back from the server. This is one way to
    do it:

    >>> from pulp_smash.api import Client
    >>> from pulp_smash.config import get_config
    >>> client = Client(get_config())
    >>> response = client.post('/pulp/api/v2/users/', {'login': 'Alice'})
    >>> response = client.get(response.json()['_href'])
    >>> print(response.json())

    Notice how we never call ``response.raise_for_status()``? We don't need to
    because, by default, ``Client`` instances do this. Handy!

    How does this work? Each ``Client`` object has a callback function,
    ``response_handler``, that is given a chance to munge each server response.
    How else might this callback be useful? Well, notice how we call ``json()``
    on each server response? That's kludgy. Let's write our own callback that
    takes care of this for us:

    >>> from pulp_smash.api import Client
    >>> from pulp_smash.config import get_config
    >>> def response_handler(client, response):
    ...     response.raise_for_status()
    ...     return response.json()
    >>> client = Client(get_config(), response_handler=response_handler)
    >>> response = client.post('/pulp/api/v2/users/', {'login': 'Alice'})
    >>> response = client.get(response['_href'])
    >>> print(response)

    Pulp Smash ships with several response handlers. In order of increasing
    complexity, see:

    * :func:`pulp_smash.api.echo_handler`
    * :func:`pulp_smash.api.code_handler`
    * :func:`pulp_smash.api.safe_handler`
    * :func:`pulp_smash.api.json_handler`
    * :func:`pulp_smash.api.page_handler`

    As mentioned, this class has configurable request and response handling
    mechanisms. We've covered response handling mechanisms â€” let's move on to
    request handling mechanisms.

    When a client is instantiated, a :class:`pulp_smash.config.PulpSmashConfig`
    must be passed to the constructor, and configuration options are copied
    from the ``PulpSmashConfig`` to the client. These options can be overridden
    on a per-object or per-request basis. Here's an example:

    >>> from pulp_smash.api import Client
    >>> from pulp_smash.config import PulpSmashConfig
    >>> cfg = config.PulpSmashConfig(
    ...     pulp_auth=('username', 'password'),
    ...     pulp_version='1!0',
    ...     pulp_selinux_enabled=True,
    ...     hosts=[
    ...         config.PulpHost(
    ...             hostname='example.com',
    ...             roles={'api': {
    ...                'scheme': 'https',
    ...                'verify': '~/Documents/my.crt',
    ...             }}
    ...         )
    ...     ]
    ... )
    >>> client = api.Client(cfg)
    >>> client.request_kwargs['url'] == 'https://example.com'
    True
    >>> client.request_kwargs['verify'] == '~/Documents/my.crt'
    True
    >>> response = client.get('/index.html')  # Use my.crt for SSL verification
    >>> response = client.get('/index.html', verify=False)  # Disable SSL
    >>> response = client.get('/index.html')  # Use my.crt for SSL verification
    >>> client.request_kwargs['verify'] = None
    >>> response = client.get('/index.html')  # Do default SSL verification

    As shown above, an argument that's passed to one of this class' methods is
    passed to the corresponding Requests method. And an argument that's set in
    ``requests_kwargs`` is passed to Requests during every call.

    The ``url`` argument is special. When making an HTTP request with Requests,
    an absolute URL is required. But when making an HTTP request with one of
    this class' methods, either an absolute or a relative URL may be passed. If
    a relative URL is passed, it's joined to this class' default URL like so:

    >>> urljoin(self.request_kwargs['url'], passed_in_url)

    This allows one to easily use the hrefs returned by Pulp in constructing
    new requests.

    :param pulp_smash.config.PulpSmashConfig cfg: Information about a Pulp app.
    :param response_handler: A callback function, invoked after each request is
        made. Must accept two arguments: a
        :class:`pulp_smash.config.PulpSmashConfig` object, and a
        ``requests.Response`` object. Defaults to :func:`safe_handler`.
    :param request_kwargs: A dict of parameters to send with each request. This
        dict is merged into the default dict of parameters that's sent with
        each request.
    :param pulp_smash.config.PulpHost pulp_host: The host with which to
        communicate. Defaults to the first host that fulfills the "api" role.

    **Supplementary information on writing response handlers.**

    This class accepts a :class:`pulp_smash.config.PulpSmashConfig` parameter.
    This object may be accessed via the ``_cfg`` attribute. This attribute
    should be used sparingly, as careless accesses can be an easy way to
    inadverdently create bugs. For example, if given the choice between calling
    ``self._cfg.get_request_kwargs()`` or referencing ``self.request_kwargs``,
    reference the latter. To explain why, consider this scenario:

    >>> from pulp_smash import api, config
    >>> client = api.Client(config.get_config())
    >>> client.request_kwargs['verify'] == '~/Documents/my.crt'
    >>> client.get('https://example.com')

    The API client has been told to use an SSL certificate for verification.
    Yet if the client uses ``self._cfg.get_requests_kwargs()`` when making an
    HTTP GET call, the SSL certificate won't be used.

    If this attribute is so problematic, why does it exist? It exists so that
    each API client may share context with its response handler. For example, a
    response handler might need to know which version of Pulp it is
    communicating with:

    >>> def example_handler(client, response):
    ...     if client._cfg.pulp_version < Version('3'):
    ...         return pulp_2_procedure(response)
    ...     else:
    ...         return pulp_3_procedure(response)

    However, this same logic could also be implemented by calling
    :func:`pulp_smash.config.get_config`:

    >>> def example_handler(client, response):
    ...     if config.get_config().pulp_version < Version('3'):
    ...         return pulp_2_procedure(response)
    ...     else:
    ...         return pulp_3_procedure(response)

    Given this, why lug around a :class:`pulp_smash.config.PulpSmashConfig`
    object? This is done because it is fundamentally correct for a response
    handler to learn about its calling API client's state by accessing the
    calling API client, and it is fundamentally incorrect for a response
    handler to learn about its calling API client's state by accessing a global
    cache. To illustrate, consider one possible failure scenario:

    1. No settings file exists at any of the default load paths, e.g.
       ``~/.config/pulp_smash/settings.json``.
    2. An API client is created by reading a non-default configuration file.
    3. The API client makes a request, and a response handler is invoked to
       handle the response.
    4. The response handler needs to learn which version of Pulp is being
       targeted.

       * If it invokes :func:`pulp_smash.config.get_config`, no configuration
         file will be found, and an exception will be raised.
       * If it accesses the calling API client, it will find what it needs.

    Letting a response handler access its calling API client prevents incorrect
    behaviour in other scenarios too, such as when working with multi-threaded
    code.

    **Supplementary information on method signatures.**

    `requests.post`_ has the following signature::

        requests.post(url, data=None, json=None, **kwargs)

    However, :func:`post` has a different signature. Why? Pulp supports only
    JSON for most of its API endpoints, so it makes sense for us to demote
    ``data`` to being a regular kwarg and list ``json`` as the one and only
    positional argument.

    We make ``json`` a positional argument for :func:`post`, :func:`put`, and
    :func:`patch`, but not the other methods. Why? Because HTTP OPTIONS, GET,
    HEAD and DELETE **must not** have bodies. This is stated by the HTTP/1.1
    specification, and network intermediaries such as caches are at liberty to
    drop such bodies.

    Why is a sentinel object used in several function signatures? Imagine the
    following scenario: a user provides a default JSON payload in
    ``self.request_kwargs``, but they want to skip sending that payload for
    just one request. How can they do that?  With ``client.post(url,
    json=None)``.
