    """Test whether one can sync modules from the Puppet Forge.

    According to `Pulp #1846`_, Pulp sometimes fails to sync modules available
    on the Puppet forge. There is no consistency regarding which modules fail
    to sync: according to one comment, Pulp only detects 40 modules (of
    ~1,800), and according to another comment, Pulp syncs 4,089 of 4,128
    modules.

    How do we test this? The ideal test case is to repeatedly sync the entire
    Puppet Forge and check for sync failures, until the probability of another
    random failure is low. This is problematic: we're abusing the Puppet Forge
    and extending the test time. A more realistic test is to sync a small
    number of modules and ensure that no errors occur. This provides much less
    assurance, but it does at least show that *a* sync from the Puppet Forge
    can complete.

    :mod:`pulp_smash.pulp2.tests.puppet.api_v2.test_sync_publish` already
    syncs from the Puppet Forge, but `Pulp #1846`_ specifically uses the CLI.

    The end result is a test case that syncs an unknown number of Puppet
    modules and which provides only minimal assurance that syncs from the
    Puppet Forge work. Unfortunately, we cannot do better.
