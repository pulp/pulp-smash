"""Tests for Pulp2.

This package and its sub-packages contain functional tests for Pulp. These
tests should be run against live Pulp systems. These tests may target all of
the different interfaces exposed by Pulp, including its API and CLI. These
tests are entirely different from the unit tests in :mod:`tests`.

A given Pulp server may have an arbitrary set of plugins installed. As a
result, not all of the tests in Pulp Smash should be run against a given Pulp
server. Consequently, tests are organized on a per-plugin basis. Tests for the
Docker plugin are in :mod:`pulp_smash.pulp2.tests.docker`, tests for the OSTree
plugin are in :mod:`pulp_smash.pulp2.tests.ostree`, and so on. Several other factors
also determine whether a test should be run, such as whether a given bug has
been fixed in the version of Pulp under test. However, plugins are the broadest
determinant of which tests should be run, so they direct the test suite
structure.

Selecting and deselecting tests is a common task, and module
:mod:`pulp_smash.selectors` has a collection of tools for this problem area. At
a minimum, *every* ``test*`` module should define a `setUpModule`_ function
that checks for the presence of needed Pulp plugins and raises a `SkipTest`_
exception if needed. For convenience, functions such as
:func:`pulp_smash.pulp2.tests.docker.utils.set_up_module` can be used for this
purpose. For example::

    >>> from pulp_smash.pulp2.tests.docker.utils import set_up_module as setUpModule

By default, Requests refuses to make insecure HTTPS connections. You can
override this behaviour by passing ``verify=False``. For example::

    requests.get('https://insecure.example.com', verify=False)

If you do this, Requests will make the connection. However, an
``InsecureRequestWarning`` will be raised. This is problematic. If a user has
explicitly stated that they want insecure HTTPS connections and they are
pestered about that fact, the user is effectively trained to ignore warnings.

This module attempts to solve that problem. When this module is imported, a
filter is prepended to the warning module's list of filters. The filter states
that ``InsecureRequestWarning`` warnings should be ignored. Note that this has
no effect on whether SSL verification is performed. Insecure HTTPS connections
are still blocked by default. The filter only has an effect on whether
``InsecureRequestWarning`` messages are displayed.

This filtering has a drawback: the warning module's filtering system is
process-wide. Imagine an application which uses both Pulp Smash and some other
library, and imagine that the other library generates
``InsecureRequestWarning`` warnings. The filter created here will suppress the
warnings raised by that application. The ``warnings.catch_warnings`` context
manager is not a good solution to this problem, as it is thread-unsafe.

This filtering is also limited: any Python code which executes after this
module is imported can also manipulate the warning module's list of filters,
and can therefore override the effects of this module. Unfortunately, the
unittest test runner from the standard library does just that. As of this
writing (with Python 3.5.3), the following filter (among others) is prepended
to the warning module's filter list whenever a test case is executed:

    >>> from warnings import filters
    >>> filters[1]
    ('default', None, <class 'Warning'>, None, 0)

This filter matches all warnings — including ``InsecureRequestWarning`` — and
causes them to be emitted. In theory, this does not occur if ``-W
'ignore::requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning'`` is
passed when calling ``python -m unittest``. A more efficacious solution is to
use a different test runner.
