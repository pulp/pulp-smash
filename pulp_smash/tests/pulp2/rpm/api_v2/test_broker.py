"""Tests for Pulp's "broker reconnect" feature.

Tests for `#55 <https://github.com/PulpQE/pulp-smash/issues/55>`_:

    Pulp offers a collection of behaviors known as "reconnect support" for the
    Pulp Broker. Here are the expected behaviors:

    * If you start a Pulp service that connects to the broker and the broker is
      not running or is not network accessible for some reason, the Pulp
      services will wait-and-retry. It has a backoff behavior, but the
      important part is that Pulp services don't exit if they can't connect due
      to availability, and when the availability problem is resolved, the Pulp
      services reconnect.
    * If you have a Pulp service connected to the broker and the broker shuts
      down, the Pulp services need the wait-and-retry as described above. Once
      the broker becomes available again the Pulp services should reconnect.

There are two scenarios to test here:

* support for initially connecting to a broker, and
* support for reconnecting to a broker that goes missing.

Both scenarios are executed by
:class:`pulp_smash.tests.pulp2.rpm.api_v2.test_broker.BrokerTestCase`.
