"""Tests for Pulp's "broker reconnect" feature.

Tests for `#55 <https://github.com/PulpQE/pulp-smash/issues/55>`_:

> Pulp offers a collection of behaviors known as "reconnect support" for the
> Pulp Broker. Here are the expected behaviors:
>
> * If you start a Pulp service that connects to the broker and the broker is
>   not running or is not network accessible for some reason, the Pulp services
>   will wait-and-retry. It has a backoff behavior, but the important part is
>   that Pulp services don't exit if they can't connect due to availability,
>   and when the availability problem is resolved, the Pulp services reconnect.
> * If you have a Pulp service connected to the broker and the broker shuts
>   down, the Pulp services need the wait-and-retry as described above. Once
>   the broker becomes available again the Pulp services should reconnect.

There are two scenarios to test here:

* support for initially connecting to a broker, and
* support for reconnecting to a broker that goes missing.

Both scenarios are executed by
:class:`pulp_smash.tests.rpm.api_v2.test_broker.BrokerTestCase`.
