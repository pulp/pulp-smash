Pulp Smash needs to know what servers it can talk to and how to talk to those

    """Facts about a server, plus methods for manipulating those facts.

    This object stores a set of facts that are used when communicating with a
    Pulp server. A typical usage of this object is as follows:

    >>> import requests
    >>> from pulp_smash.config import ServerConfig
    >>> cfg = ServerConfig(
    ...     base_url='https://pulp.example.com',
    ...     auth=('username', 'password'),
    ...     verify=False,  # Disable SSL verification
    ...     version='2.7.5',
    ... )
    >>> response = requests.post(
    ...     cfg.base_url + '/pulp/api/v2/actions/login/',
    ...     **cfg.get_requests_kwargs()
    ... )

    One can also :meth:`save` a ``ServerConfig`` out to a file, :meth:`read`
    one back and more. By way of example, assume that a file with the following
    contents exists on the filesystem::

        {
          "pulp": {"base_url": "example.com", "auth": ["alice", "hackme"]},
          "pulp agent": {"base_url": "example.org", "auth": ["bob", "hackme"]},
        }

    The two top-level sections can be read like so:

    >>> from pulp_smash.config import ServerConfig
    >>> 'example.com' == ServerConfig().read('pulp').base_url
    >>> 'example.org' == ServerConfig().read('pulp agent').base_url

    By default, :meth:`read` reads the "pulp" section. As a result, this
    holds true:

    >>> from pulp_smash.config import ServerConfig
    >>> ServerConfig().read() == ServerConfig().read('pulp')
    >>> ServerConfig().read() != ServerConfig().read('pulp agent')

    All methods dealing with files obey the `XDG Base Directory Specification
    <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_.
    Please read the specification for insight into the logic of those methods.

    In addition, the file-facing methods respect the ``PULP_SMASH_CONFIG_FILE``
    environment variable. By default, the methods work with a file named
    ``settings.json``, but the environment variable overrides that default. If
    set, the environment variable should be a file name like ``settings2.json``
    (or a relative path), *not* an absolute path.

    :param base_url: A string. A protocol, hostname and optionally a port. For
        example, ``'http://example.com:250'``. Do not append a trailing slash.
    :param auth: A two-tuple. Credentials to use when communicating with the
        server. For example: ``('username', 'password')``.
    :param verify: A boolean. Should SSL be verified when communicating with
        the server?
    :param version: A string, such as '1.2' or '0.8.rc3'. Defaults to '1!0'
        (epoch 1, version 0). Must be compatible with the `packaging`_
        library's ``packaging.version.Version`` class.
    :param cli_transport: Either 'local' or 'ssh'. See
        :class:`pulp_smash.cli.Client` for details.
